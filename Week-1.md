Biography landing page requirements
Planning landing pages is better when we divide by sections

Section 1
- Include a header with your full name
- Include relevant information like age, hometown, birthday, etc
- Include an image of yourself
- Include a short paragraph about yourself

Section 2
- Include your favorite dish to make with an image and header 
- Include a paragraph on why you chose the dish
- Create a list of ingredients for the dish and information for making it

Section 3
- Include a heading for your favorite videos or music
- Include hyperlinks to your favorite videos or songs
- Describe why you chose those videos or songs

Note: This should be all on one html file.
