Frontend Development HW 2
(Estimated complete time 6 hours)

After we dove into the concept of frontend development and took a glimpse at HTML and CSS we will now move onto the main language that we will need to build intuition for which is JavaScript.
For a while we are going to be working on just JavaScript then eventually bring everything together to build web applications. 
JavaScript is going to be very important as a frontend developer as we will build upon HTML and CSS by using JavaScript frameworks that make coding frontend applications easier. 
The JavaScript framework that I will be sharing with y'all is React.js which is a very sought after frontend framework but for now we need to understand vanilla JavaScript before we start using React.js. 

1. Learn about Git and GitHub. Install GitHub desktop and create you own account. I would like for you to commit any work or notes you take to your GitHub account to start building a new GitHub account with repositories.
